\section{Summary}

This dissertation set out to to alleviate the state of scholarly data. In order to achieve this, the following research objective was set.

\begin{infobox-objective}
\textbf{Research Objective}\\
Develop an automated process that takes as input scientific publications, and produces as output a high-quality derivate representation of the publications suitable for digital processing.
\end{infobox-objective}

Criteria for high-quality were defined across the following dimensions.\footnote{See Table~\ref{tab:scholdataquali} in Chapter~\ref{chp:foundations} for the list of criteria.}

\begin{infobox-progress}
      \textbf{Data Quality Dimensions}\\
       (1)~relevance, (2)~accuracy, (3)~timeliness, (4)~comparability, (5)~completeness
\end{infobox-progress}

To focus the efforts of improving scholarly data quality, three areas were identified in which scholarly data based on existing work particularly has limitations.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Completeness of the \textbf{citation network}
    \item Coverage of \textbf{non-English content}
    \item Structured representation of \textbf{research artifacts}
\end{enumerate}

To achieve improvements in these areas, the following steps were performed. In Chapter~\ref{chp:corpus} we developed a corpus creation method transforming publications' \LaTeX\ source files into a large-scale corpus of of interlinked, full-text documents. The presented method also includes a highly accurate reference matching procedure. Applying our method on the complete set of all publications on arXiv.org, we created the data set \emph{unarXive}, which was used as a basis for all subsequent work. %``Corpus''
In Chapter~\ref{chp:covgran} we presented improvements regarding the citation network and the granularity of document representations. For the citation network, a blocking technique was developed that, applied on the set of references in a corpus, increases the number of matched references and bibliographic couplings. With an updated corpus creation method, the \emph{unarXive} data set achieved a more complete, state-of-the-art citation network. The updated procedure furthermore enabled more fine-granular document representations, which in turn made the subsequent work in Chapter~\ref{chp:params} possible. %``Reference Coverage and Granularity''
In Chapter~\ref{chp:xling} we studied cross-lingual citations in the \emph{unarXive} corpus. For this, we found a method to reliably identify this type of citation based on raw reference strings. In our study, which is the largest of its kind to date, we analysed cross-lingual citations' prevalence, usage, and impact. %``References Across Languages''
Lastly, in Chapter~\ref{chp:params} we developed methods for extracting information about research artifacts and their usage parameters from publication full-texts. Applying our best performing method on \emph{unarXive}, we found difference in parameter reporting patterns across several disciplines. %``References with Usage Parameters''

The presented work makes the following contributions towards the research objective.

\section{Conclusion}

Structured representations of scientific publications bear immense potential for efficiency gains in academia, as well as offering a remedy for the information overflow scientists are faced with.
Our current ``digital record of science'', however, is limited in various ways. This not only prevents faster progress, but also means decisions based on current scholarly data can be flawed and analysis results faulty.
Particularly, the \emph{citation networks} in scholarly data are incomplete, \emph{non-English content} is often not covered, and increasingly relevant \emph{research artifacts} are not available as structured data.

In this dissertation, we made significant progress in all three aforementioned areas, as laid out in the previous section. With this, we achieved comprehensive improvements of data quality, as determined across the five dimensions relevance, accuracy, timeliness, comparability, and completeness. Furthermore, the presented work already made an impact on the research fields concerned with scholarly data and the study of publications. Below, we give a brief account of ideas and results from this dissertation permeating into and being used in the research community.

    \item Use of \textbf{methodology}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In~\cite{Lo2020} Lo et al.\ use our corpus creation methodology for creating the \LaTeX\ subset of their S2ORC data set.

        \item In~\cite{Parisot2022} Parisot and Zavrel train a novel multi-objective representation learning technique for scientific document retrieval on our data.
        \item With Researcher2Vec Mochihashi present a method for researcher profile embeddings in~\cite{Mochihashi2023}, using our data to validate their approach.
        %\item Reference Linking~(\cite{Saier2022ULITE})
    \end{itemize}
    \item Use for \textbf{analyses}

Compared to other efforts with the goal to create high-quality scholarly data, our work particularly stands out through the combination of three key aspects. (1) Accurate, fine-granular document representations, (2) a citation network, and (3) applicability on a large scale due to being automated. The closest related work, S2ORC~\cite{Lo2020}, predominantly uses PDF data and therefore does not provide the same level of granularity (e.g. mathematical notation) and is more prone to noise. arXMLiv~\cite{arXMLiv}, while providing accurate, fine-granular document representations, lacks a citation network. Lastly, the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG)~\cite{orkg1,orkg2} relies on manual or only semi-automated adding of data, and is therefore lacking in scale.

Our work using \LaTeX\ as the starting point, however, also comes as a price. While theoretically \LaTeX\ is suitable to write papers in any field, it is not commonly used in certain areas, such as the humanities. Practically speaking, a representative portion of publications is available as \LaTeX\ sources in physics, mathematics, and computer science---those found on arXiv.org. In other areas, such as the life sciences, large quantities of publications in JATS XML format are available. However, their supply relies on manual efforts provided by publishers. In disciplines other that the aforementioned, only PDFs are available. This means in turn that currently efforts operating on PDF files, such as S2ORC, are more widely applicable. Our work in the focus areas citation network, non-English content, and research artifacts---presented in Chapters~\ref{chp:covgran}, \ref{chp:xling} and \ref{chp:params} respectively---is not reliant on \LaTeX\ though, meaning that given suitable input, they

% TODO: consider discussing arXiv being a preprint server and the level of difference between preprints on arXiv and their published counterpart

% Note that in other contexts the term ``scholarly data'' can have a broader meaning than just ``structured representations of scientific publications''. For example, it can also include data on research institutions or funding bodies, without necessitating the context of a publication.

\section{Outlook}

Bigger picture, publishing as a whole (e.g. paper as unit of publication micropublications~\cite{Raciti2018})
There are, however, efforts by The \LaTeX\ Project\refurl{https://www.latex-project.org/}{2023-11-08} itself to support semantic annotation natively in the future~\cite{Mittelbach2020,Mittelbach2023}.
