\Abstract{}
% motivation
Scientific publications are written by humans \emph{for humans}.
However, vital infrastructure in academia relies on the processing of publications \emph{by computers}.
For example, academic search engines and performance indicators, which are indispensable for literature review and decision making, require machine-readable representations of publications.
Bridging the gap from a medium \emph{for humans} to something suitable for processing \emph{by computers} is a challenging and error-prone process.

% gap
Existing methods for the creation of data representing publications, and by extension the data they produce, are limited in various ways. Specifically, there are shortcomings regarding documents' interconnections, language coverage, and content representation granularity. For example, widely used data sets have highly incomplete citation networks, are limited to publications written in English, or fail to accurately capture mathematical notation. As a consequence, applications and research building on this data are of limited scope and validity.

% solution
To address these issues, we present a set of data mining and information extraction approaches that enable the creation of machine-readable publication corpora more complete, extensive, and of finer granularity than previously available. We quantify our contributions to better data quality along the dimensions relevance, accuracy, timeliness, comparability, and completeness, and achieve improvements across all of them.

In particular, we present the following.
As the foundation of our research, we introduce a method for creating a large-scale corpus of linked, full-text documents from publications' \LaTeX\ sources.
Utilizing the resulting corpus, we further present approaches yielding advances in three areas.
First, we demonstrate improvements in the completeness of citation networks though the use of a blocking and matching method, as well as improvements in the granularity of document representations.
Second, we show advances in the language coverage of document interconnections through identifying and analyzing cross-lingual citations.
Third, we present information extraction approaches for fine-granular representations of research artifacts and their parameters.

% summary
Overall, our approaches address key shortcomings of existing methods for the creation of data representing publications.
For each of our approaches, we demonstrate its viability and benefits through evaluations and practical large-scale applications.
Our methods have already been adopted in several parts of the research community, which further confirms their utility.
